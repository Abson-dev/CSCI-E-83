## Introduction   

Despite the long history, Bayesian models have not been used extensively until recently    

- 

- Limited use is a result of several difficulties   
   - The need to specify a **prior distribution** has proved a formidable intellectual obstacle    
   - Modern Bayesian methods are often computationally intensive and have become practical only with cheap computing     
   
- Recent emergence of improved software and algorithms has resulted in wide and practical access to Bayesian methods         


## Bayesian Model Use Case

Bayesian methods made global headlines with the successful location of the missing Air France Flight 447   

- Aircraft had disappeared in little traveled area of the South Atlantic Ocean     
- Conventional location methods had failed to locate the wreckage; potential search area too large    
- Bayesian methods rapidly narrowed the prospective search area   


```{r AirFrance447, out.width = '35%', fig.cap='Posterior distribution of locations of Air France 447', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/AirFrance447_posterior_PDF.png"))
```
