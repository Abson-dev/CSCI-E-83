## Introduciton      

Sampling is a fundamental process in the collection and analysis of data    

- Sampling is important because we almost never have data on a whole population   

- Sampling must be randomized to preclude biases    

- Key points to keep in mind:   
  - Understanding sampling is essential to ensure data is representative of the entire population   
  - Use inferences on the sample to say something about the population   
  - The sample must be randomly drawn from the population  

- Sampling from distribution is the building block of simulation     

- We wil take up the topic of resampling later

## Sampling Example


| Use Case | Sample | Population |
|---|---|---|
| A/B Testing | The users we show either web sites A or B | All possible users, past present and future|   
|World Cup Soccer | 32 teams which qualify in one season | All national teams in past, present and future years|   
|Average height of data science students | Students in a data science class | All students taking data science classes world wide|   
|Tolerances of a manufactured part | Samples taken from production lines | All parts manufactured in the past, present and future |   
|Numbers of a species in a habitat |Population counts from sampled habitats |All possible habitats in the past, present and future |   

- In several cases it is not only impractical, but impossible to collect data from the entire population  

- We nearly always work with samples, rather than the entire population.

## Importance of random sampling   

All statistical methods rely on the use of **randomized unbiased samples**    

- Failure to randomized samples violates many key assumptions of statistical models     

- An understanding of proper use of sampling methods is essential to statistical inference      

- Most commonly used machine learning algorithms assume that training data are **unbiased** and **independent identically distributed (iid)**   
  - These conditions only met if training data sample is randomized   
  - Otherwise, the training data will be biased and not represent the underlying process distribution
