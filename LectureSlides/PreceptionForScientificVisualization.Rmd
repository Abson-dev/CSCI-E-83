## Why This Course?     


**Data science** is the science of **understanding data**   

- Statistics is the science of making **principled inferences** from data    
  - Inference leads to understanding     
  - Inference is becoming harder with large complex data sets  

- Doing rigorous data science requires understanding statistics     
  - Statistical practice has advanced significantly to address large complex data sets    
  - Statistical practice now dominated by computer-intensive methods


-----------------------------------------------------------------

## What We'll Cover     

Our focus is on the big ideas of computer-intensive statistics and data analysis arising in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries     

- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand relationships in big complex data sets          
- **Foundational generic algorithms** used throughout statistics and machine learning including, maximum likelihood estimation, MCMC sampleing and the EM algorithm (time permitting)

- **Resampling methods** for building models and inference    

- **Large scale hypothesis testing** for complex and high-dimensional data sets   

- **Bayesian hierarchical models** for complex processes     

- **Over-parameterized models and regularization** to model complex high-dimensional data 

- **Robust staztistics** to deal with data violating model assumptions - time permitting


----------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Exploration and Visualization?    

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** tools are essential to good data science

- Why not just start building machine learning models?   

- Understanding relationships in data saves missteps and unexplained poor model performance     
  - Which variables are actually important?   
  - How do these variables behave?   
  - Are there errors and outliers in the data?  
  - How good is a model fit? 

- Communications is an important component of data science     
  - Analytic results are only useful if they are understood and trusted     
  - Graphical presentation greatly assists understanding by less technical colleagues    

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Why is Perception Important?  


- **Goal:** Communicate information visually
- Visualization technique maximize the information a viewer perceives
- limits of human perception are a significant factor in understanding complex relationships
- Can apply results of the considerable research on human perceptions for data visualization


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Use Aesthetics to Improve Perception 

- Use aesthetics to improve perception
- We take a very broad view of the term 'aesthetic' here
- A plot aesthetics is any property of a visualization which highlight aspects of the data relationships
- Aesthetics are used to project additional dimensions of complex data onto the 2-dimensional plot surface


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Organization of Plot Aesthetics

We can organize aesthetics by their effectiveness:   

1. **Easy to perceive plot aesthetics:** help most people gain understanding of data relationships    

2. **Aesthetics with moderate perceptive power:** useful properties to project data relationships when used sparingly         

3. **Aesthetics with limited perceptive power:** useful within strict limits     


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Properties of Common Aesthetics

| Property or Aesthetic |Perception| Data Types |
|:---------|:-----------|:------------|
|Aspect ratio | Good | Numeric |
|Regression lines | Good | Numeric plus categorical |
|Marker position | Good | Numeric |
|Bar length | Good | Counts, numeric |
|Sequential color palette | Moderate | Numeric, ordered categorical |
|Marker size | Moderate | Numeric, ordered categorical |
|Line types | Limited | Categorical |
|Qualitative color palette | Limited | Categorical|
| Marker shape | Limited | Categorical |
| Area | Limited | Numeric or categorical |
| Angle | Limited | Numeric |


```{python, echo=FALSE}
#import sys
#sys.path.append('./source')
#import computationalStatisticsBook as csb
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
from math import log, sqrt
import seaborn as sns
from math import log, sqrt, sin
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#%matplotlib inline

auto_price = pd.read_csv('../data//AutoPricesClean.csv')
```


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Aspect Ratio


- **Aspect ratio** has a significant influence on how a viewer perceives a chart
- Correct aspect ratio can help highlight important relationships in complex data sets
- We express aspect ratio as follows:     

$$aspect\ ratio = \frac{width}{height}\ : 1$$


- **Banking angle** is key to understanding how the aspect ratio affects perception 


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Example of Changing Aspect Ratio

Longest scientific time series is the sunspot count: 

```{python, echo=FALSE}
sunspots_data = sm.datasets.sunspots.load_pandas().data
sunspots_data.head()
```



-----------------------------------------------------------

## Example of Changing Aspect Ratio

- Example uses data from 1700 to 1980
- Can you perceive the asymmetry in these sunspot cycles? 


```{python, echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))
fig.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.3)
ax = sns.lineplot(x='YEAR', y='SUNACTIVITY', data=sunspots_data, ci=None, ax=ax)
_=ax.set_title('Sunspot time series with 1:1 aspect ratio', fontsize=8)
_=ax.set_xlabel('Date', fontsize=8)
_=ax.set_ylabel('Sunspots', fontsize=8)
_=ax.tick_params(labelsize=8)
plt.show()
```


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Example of Changing Aspect Ratio

- Notice how changing aspect ratio change perception of the asymmetry?

```{python, echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 1.0))
fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.75, bottom=0.4)
ax = sns.lineplot(x='YEAR', y='SUNACTIVITY', data=sunspots_data, ci=None, ax=ax)
_=ax.set_title('Sunspot time series with 1:10 aspect ratio') 
_=ax.set_xlabel('Date')
_=ax.set_ylabel('Sunspots', fontsize=8)
_=ax.tick_params(labelsize=8)
plt.show()
```


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Sequential and Divergent Color Palettes

Use of **color** as an aesthetic in visualization is a complicated subject. 

- color is often used, also often abused 
- A **qualitative palette** is a palette of individual colors  to display categorical values
- **Sequential palettes** and **divergent palettes** are a sequence of colors used to display a quantitative variable or ordered categorical variable


-------------------------------------------------------------

## Auto Weight by Sequential Color Palette

```{python, echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4,4))
fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.8, bottom=0.2)
ax = sns.scatterplot(x='city_mpg', y='curb_weight', data=auto_price, 
                     hue = 'price', palette = 'magma', ax=ax)
_=ax.set_title('City MPG vs. Weight \nPrice by color') #, fontsize=12)
_=ax.set_xlabel('City MPG') # , fontsize=12)
_=ax.set_ylabel('Vehicle Weight') #, fontsize=12) 
plt.show()
```


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Limits of color

Regardless of the approach there are some significant limitations

- A significant number of people are color blind. Red-green color blindness is most common 
- Even the best sequential or divergent palettes show only relative value of numeric variables
- Perception of exact numeric values is difficult, except in special cases


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Marker Size

**Marker size** is moderately effective aesthetic useful for quantitative variables

- Used properly, marker size can highlight important trends in complex data sets 
- But, the viewer can generally perceive relative differences, but not actual values 
- Small size differences are not preceptable  


-----------------------------------------------

## Engine Size by Marker Size and Price by Sequential Color Palette     

```{python, echo=FALSE}
ax = sns.scatterplot(x='city_mpg', y='curb_weight', data=auto_price,
                     hue = 'price', palette = 'magma',
                     size = 'engine_size', sizes = (50.0, 400.0))
_=ax.set_title('City MPG vs. Weight \nPrice by color, engine size by size') #, fontsize=18)
_=ax.set_xlabel('City MPG') #, fontsize=16)
_=ax.set_ylabel('Vehicle Weight')# , fontsize=16) 
plt.show()
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Line Plots and Line Type

**Line plots** connect discrete, ordered, data points by a line

- Can use different line pattern types to differentiate data 
- Only useful for a limited number of lines on one graph
- Too many similar line pattern on one plot leads to viewer confusion and poor perception

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits of Line Type

```{python, echo=FALSE}
## Compute some transformed variables
sunspot_mean = sunspots_data.loc[:,'SUNACTIVITY'].mean()
y1 = [z/sunspot_mean for z in sunspots_data.loc[:,'SUNACTIVITY']]
y2 = [log(z + 0.01) for z in y1]
y3 = [1.0/(z + 0.1) for z in y1]
y4 = [sqrt(z) for z in y1]
## Construct the data frame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Date':sunspots_data.loc[:,'YEAR'],'Normalized':y1, 'Log':y2, 'Inverse':y3, 'Sqrt':y4})
## Convert the floating point year to a Pandas datetime type
df.loc[:,'Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.loc[:,'Date'].astype(int),format='%Y')

styles = [':','-.','--','-'] # Some line styles
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4)) # define plot area
ax = fig.gca() # define axis   
temp = df[(df['Date'] > '1900-01-01') & (df['Date'] <= '1919-12-01')]
## Iterate over the time series and line styles to plot
for col, style in zip(temp[['Normalized','Log','Inverse','Sqrt']], styles):    
    _=ax.plot(temp.Date, temp[col], linestyle = style, color = 'b', label=(col+'(sunspots)'), linewidth=1)
## Annotate the plot, including legend
_=ax.set_title('Line plot of transformed sunspot data \nwith multiple line types') 
_=ax.set_xlabel('Date') # Set text for the x axis
_=ax.set_ylabel('Values')# Set text for y axis    
_=ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Marker Shape

**Marker shape** is useful for displaying categorical relationships

- This aesthetic is only useful when two conditions are met:
1. The number of categories is small
2. Distinctive shape are chosen for the markers
- Human perception limits the number of shapes humans can perceive well

-------------------------------------------------------

## Aspiration by Marker Shape    

```{python, echo=FALSE}
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4)) # define plot area
fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.7)
ax=sns.scatterplot(x = 'city_mpg', y = 'curb_weight', 
                      style = 'aspiration', 
                      hue = 'fuel_type', 
                      data=auto_price)
_=ax.set_title('City MPG vs. Weight \nAspiration by marker shape \nFuel type by color')
_=ax.set_xlabel('City MPG')
_=ax.set_ylabel('Vehicle Weight') 
plt.show()
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

We have  explored these key points       
- Proper use of plot aesthetics enable projection of multiple dimensions of complex data onto the 2-dimensional plot surface.     
- All plot aesthetics have limitations which must be understood to use them effectively     
- The effectiveness of a plot aesthetic varies with the type and the application
